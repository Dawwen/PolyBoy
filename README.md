## Description

The goal of this project is to create a portable console based on Arduino Due. For this purpose, our portable console is equipped with a `TFT` screen, a `SD` card reader, a speaker, a gyroscope, a bluetooth module and other sensors and actuators. In the future, we think of developing an interface allowing to launch several games and applications.
